# this is my final project for the cs5o course

## iam zeyad belal from portsaid city , egypt

### this is a memory game i built using javascript , css ,html

you have to get all the cards right to win
included also a score to keep track of your tries to make the game more challenging

## html and css
the logic behind it that you have an element with twi faces fromt and back with a click you triger an event that rotate the element 180 deg and put a class flipped on it

## js
**my code check if  there there is two elements with class flipped**
that mean you flipped two cards
if the same have the same id which i store in the custom data attrbuite thats mean they have similar photos so they will have class matched and stay flipped otherwise they will flipp again to thier normal state

i also added a tracker for your tries to make the game more challenging .. it only counts if the two pics didnt match otherwise it doesnt count a try so you can cgallenge your friends

*all pics included is just random pics for footbal clubs , teams , technology , or social media .*
